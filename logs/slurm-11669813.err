***************************************************
You have loaded an anaconda module
***************************************************

JUST LOADING THIS MODULE DOES *NOT* CHANGE THE PYTHON VERSION, NOR ENABLES ANY
EXTRA PYTHON MODULES.

This module makes available the 'conda' command, with which users can create
named anaconda environments and then activate them.

To create and use a customized environment use 'conda create ...' and
then 'conda activate ...' (see example below).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: NSC strongly advices against placing 'conda activate' (with or without
arguments)
      in your shell initialization files, (e.g. '.bashrc' or '.bash_profile')
since this
      severly alters the environment for running software in ways that cause
unpredictable
      issues that can be difficult to diagnose.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example usage:

  * Setting up a customized Anaconda environment and run a Python program in
it:

    conda create -n myenv python=3.8 scipy=1.5.2
    conda activate myenv
    python my_scipy_python_program.py

  * To run the python program in the same environment when logging in the next
time:

    conda activate myenv
    python my_scipy_python_program.py
